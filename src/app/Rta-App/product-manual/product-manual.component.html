                <h2>Description &amp; Intended Use</h2>
                <p>SkinTE is a fully autologous (from the patient for the patient), homologous (performing same basic functions of skin tissue) cutaneous construct that should only be used by skilled medical professionals.</p>
                <p>SkinTE is intended to be used by physicians or other appropriate healthcare providers for homologous uses of the skin and integumentary system. Patients who have suffered from an event, disease, process or who have an acquired defect that
                    has resulted in the functional loss or absence of the skin and integumentary system can use SkinTE as an adjunct and/or in place of split-thickness skin grafting, full-thickness grafting, temporizing skin coverage and/or skin substitute
                    products. Each package of SkinTE is intended for autologous use that is patient-specific and for a single application.</p>

                <h2>Contraindications &amp; Warnings</h2>
                <p>SkinTE is for <strong>AUTOLOGOUS USE ONLY</strong>.</p>
                <p>Aseptic technique is <strong>MANDATORY</strong> at all times when harvesting skin as well as during the deployment of SkinTE.</p>
                <p>SkinTE use is contraindicated in patients who have suffered autoimmune responses to the auto-transplantation of their own tissues or who are sensitive to any of the antibiotics listed on the package.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> SkinTE in patients that are severely immunocompromised.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> SkinTE if the packaging or related contents appear to have been damaged, manipulated or opened prior to harvest or deployment.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> SkinTE if there is questionable contamination of the materials.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> SkinTE if the temperature tracker depicts a violation of the temperature boundaries (outside of 0-10˚C).</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> SkinTE if the patient identification number (PIN) listed on the tissue product does not match the patient identification number for the specific patient.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> SkinTE if the tissue product has leaked outside of its intended carriers.</p>
                <p><strong>DO NOT RE-USE</strong> SkinTE, as the product is packaged for deployment and is intended for single-use application.</p>
                <blockquote>Cryopreservation: SkinTE active units can be cryopreserved for later autologous use following current good tissue practices (cGTP) processing, but this request must be communicated to and confirmed by PolarityTE prior to processing.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <p><strong>DO NOT STERILIZE</strong> SkinTE, as the product contains living autologous, homologous tissue for a specific indicated patient. Sterilization of the tissue product will result in death of the cells and tissues and prevent appropriate
                    biological function.</p>
                <blockquote>WARNING: cGTP manufacturing of the tissue, laboratory testing and careful screening of incoming specimen minimize the risks of tissue product contamination. As with any processed tissues, SkinTE cannot be guaranteed to be free of all pathogens.
                    No long-term studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or reproductive impact of the clinical application of the SkinTE construct. SkinTE manufacturing complies with national standards for tissue
                    processing and monitors for contamination following clinical deployment. Please contact PolarityTE immediately if there are concerns or questions regarding issues of potential contamination.</blockquote>

                <p>Patients with multiple comorbidities, or who are in poor general health, or who have any condition that could compromise recipient site vascularity and wound healing should be carefully evaluated prior to using SkinTE. Such conditions
                    may prevent successful outcomes or lead to suboptimal results. Failure to use SkinTE by expiration date can lead to suboptimal outcomes.</p>
                <p>Whenever clinical circumstances require use in a site that is contaminated or infected, appropriate local and/or systemic anti-infective measures must be taken. Unused or expired tissue product should be discarded according to local, state,
                    federal and institutional regulations. Utilization of the SkinTE construct, process and/or technology is limited to healthcare professionals and facilities that are capable of handling such tissue products.</p>
                <p>Proper aseptic procedural and/or surgical handling is mandatory when using SkinTE. Failure to ensure proper aseptic technique may result in contamination of the tissue product and wound bed. Contamination of the tissue product and/or wound
                    bed could result in local, regional, or systemic infection, partial or complete failure of graft take, healing, and/or regeneration, serious injury, and/or death.</p>
                <p>Failure to follow instructions may lead to sub optimal outcomes, product failure and/or patient harm.</p>

                <h2>Adverse Events</h2>
                <p>An "adverse reaction" for SkinTE, which is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration as a human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based product (HCT/P) regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health
                    Service Act, is defined as a noxious and unintended response to any HCT/P for which there is a reasonable possibility that the HCT/P caused the response (21 CFR 1271.3(y)). Whenever an HCT/P recipient experiences an unintended response,
                    there may be multiple possible causes. Nevertheless, if one of the reasonable possibilities is that the HCT/P caused the response, then this would meet the definition of "adverse reaction".</p>
                <p>Adverse reactions potentially attributable to SkinTE must be reported promptly to PolarityTE. Adverse reactions can be reported to the Medical Affairs Division by calling 1-800-476-6057 or emailing <a href="mailto:MedicalAffairs@PolarityTE.com">MedicalAffairs@PolarityTE.com.</a></p>

                    NOTE: When excising the full-thickness skin for downstream SkinTE applications, it is best to use a sharp scalpel and include all layers of the skin from epidermis to subcutaneous fat. Do not use thermal devices or electrocautery while harvesting the
                    full-thickness skin graft because the heat generated may damage the living cells and tissues within the excised specimen. Surgical excision of tissue should be performed following standard sterile procedural guidelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOTE: Place the excised skin into the sterile specimen cup with the crystalloid solution and gentamicin antibiotic. Secure the lid onto the container in order to prevent leak during transport.

                <ol>
                    <li>Upon receipt of the SkinTE deployment box, ensure the following:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The tamper seal is in place and there are no signs of tampering, contamination or tissue product leakage.</li>
                            <li>Identify the tissue product label and ensure that the expiration date has not passed and the PIN correlates with the intended patient.</li>
                            <li>Refrigerate upon receipt between 1-10°C (34-50°F) if the tissue product is not going to be used the same day.<br><br><img src="/assets/rtaApp-assets/product-manual/ifu_pg13_deploykmentLabel.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1893"></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the product is ready to use, open the SkinTE deployment box. The tissue product is enclosed in an insulated cooling pack system with (3) additional sequential barrier bags. Validate that the specimen PIN located on the FedEx label
                        and internal sticker match the patient identity.</li>
                    <li>Each bag is sterile on the inside. Remove the bagged product and allow someone with sterile gloves to reach into bag 3 to remove bag 2.</li>
                    <li>Once the patient wound bed is prepared per clinical guidelines, dispense the SkinTE tissue product onto the surface of the wound bed. Dress the wound using a non-adherent, occlusive, non-absorbent dressing placed directly over the
                        SkinTE product. Recommended dressings have been included in the deployment box if needed. Failure to use a non-adherent, occlusive, non-absorbent dressing may prevent successful outcomes or lead to suboptimal results.<br><br>

                    <li>Treat the dressing changes and monitoring in the same manner that would be used for application of a skin graft. Failure to ensure a moist wound environment can prevent successful outcomes or lead to suboptimal results. The first dressing
                        change should occur on post-application days 3-5.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> Following verification of the patient PIN and that the expiration date has not passed, prepare the wound bed in a standard clinical and sterile manner. Deploy the product as a paste to cover the surface of the excised wound
                    bed. Smear the product across the surface of the wound bed. Apply the same dressings over the SkinTE that would be used for skin grafts.</p>
